# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

    It allows you to run code based on if the statement is true or false.

Researched answer:

    A statement that allows the execution of different code blocks based on the evaluation of a boolean expression. (Assisted by Khan Academy)

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:

    Git lets you track the changes to your code and Github is a web service that allows you to save and share your code online. 

Researched answer:

    Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in code, while GitHub is a web-based platform used for hosting and sharing Git repositories. (Assisted by freeCodeCamp)

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer:

    Operators that return Bolean values are:
        ==, ===, !=, >, <, &&, ||, ! and combinations of them.

Researched answer:

    The comparison operators, such as "equal to" (==), "not equal to" (!=), "less than" (<), "greater than" (>), and their variations, will return a Boolean value indicating whether the comparison is true or false. Additionally, logical operators, such as "and" (&&), "or" (||), and "not" (!), also return Boolean values based on the evaluation of the operands. (Assisted by Codeacademy)

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer:

    An index is a position in a collection of data. A value is the data that is kept in the index. So, the index tells you where the value is in the collection.

Researched answer:

    An index is a reference number that represents the position of an element in an ordered collection, such as an array or a string. The value is the actual data stored at that position, which can be of any type, such as a number, a string, or an object. The main difference between an index and a value is that the index is used to locate the value within the collection. (Assisted by Mozilla MDN Web Docs)

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer:

    They both contain data that is in order and can be accessed using index; you can also check their length. Arrays can contain different types of data, while string only contain characters and symbols, also you can't change a string.

Researched answer:

    Arrays and strings are similar because they are both collections of ordered data. However, arrays can store different types of data, and can be modified, while strings can only store characters and are immutable. Both can be accessed using an index, have a length property, and can be looped over. (Assisted by Eloquent JavaScript)

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer:

    Programming with a partner, where one is a driver and the other is a navigator. The driver writes the code, while the navigator gives prompts, checks the code, and gives the driver feedback. The driver and the navigator will swap places so that they both can learn from each other and ultimately be better programmers.

Researched answer:

    In pair programming, two people work together on the same task, with one person acting as the driver and the other as the navigator. The driver is responsible for writing the code, while the navigator reviews the code, offers feedback, and suggests improvements. By taking turns in these roles, both participants can stay engaged, share knowledge, and produce high-quality code. (Assisted by GitLab)

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: 

    Functions that take other functions as input or output; and allow for generic and reusable code.

2. Jest: 

    It allows developers to write and run automated tests. It helps catch bugs and errors, and makes it easier to refactor your code without introducing new issues.

3. Objects:  

    A way to represent something, like a cat or a refrigerator. It has characteristics called properties and actions called methods that define what it can do. Using them can make your code organized and reusable.

4. Method:

    Functions attached to objects and are accessed using "dot notation." They are used to perform actions or return information about the object.

5. Classes:

    Templates that define the properties and methods of an object. You can create more objects that use the same classes; and can be used to implement object-oriented programming.
